                <h2>About <abbr title="The Great Abar Khabo Restaurant">Us</abbr></h2>
                <p>It was the mission of Late Umashankar Pal to bring the best of Kolkattaiya biryani at
                    affordable prices - biryani by the Kolkatans; for the Kolkatans! That dream took flight 
                    when The Great Abar Khabo Restaurant &lpar;then named Uma Biryani House&rpar; got
                    started from an unused makeshift garrage in Potoldanga back in 1982. Kolkatans cherished
                    our biryani so much that Uma Biryani House was forced to shift to a new and spacious 
                    location. As of today, the <abbr title="The Great Abar Khabo Restaurants">TGAKR</abbr> 
                    group boasts of eight outlets across Greater Kolkata and is in the process to set up
                    shops at Bengaluru, Mumbai and Hyderabad.

                        <p>While biryani is popularly associated with the Mughals, there is some historical 
                        evidence to show that there were other, similar rice dishes prior to the Mughal invasion.
                        There is mention of a rice dish known as “Oon Soru” in Tamil as early as the year 2 A.D. 
                        Oon Soru was composed of rice, ghee, meat, turmeric, coriander, pepper, and bay leaf, 
                        and was used to feed military warriors.</p>
